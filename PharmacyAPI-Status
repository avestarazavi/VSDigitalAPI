    <h1>Ongoing Issues</h1>
    <h2>1. Out-dated Order Statuses</h2>
    <p>There are Greenwich orders that are SHIPPED/DELIVERED but they are showing as PENDING/PROCESSING in our system.</p>
    <p><b>Root Cause: </b>Greenwich is not updating the order status correctly. Therefore Wellsync does not have updated status. Therefore we don't have updated status.</p>
    <p><b>Resolution: </b>Wellsync is working with Greenwich to resolve the issue. Once Wellsync updates the statuses, we will update our statuses.</p>
    <p><b>ETA: </b>N/A</p>
